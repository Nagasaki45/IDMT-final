abstract = {Audiences of live laptop music frequently express dismay at the opacity of performer activity and question how ``live" performances actually are. Yet motionless laptop performers endure as musical spectacles from clubs to concert halls, suggesting that for many this is a non-issue. Understanding these perceptions might help performers better achieve their intentions, inform interface design within the NIME field and help develop theories of liveness and performance. To this end, a study of listeners' perception of liveness and performer control in laptop performance was carried out, in which listeners examined several short audio-only excerpts of laptop performances and answered questions about their perception of the performance: what they thought was happening and its sense of liveness. Our results suggest that audiences are likely to associate liveness with perceived performer activity such as improvisation and the audibility of gestures, whereas perceptions of generative material, backing tracks, or other preconceived material do not appear to inhibit perceptions of liveness.},

abstract = {Visualized emotion can be transmitted through minimal physical gestures in a musical performance; this process can be described as 'sentic', a term originally coined by Manfred Clynes in the 1970s during research into the effects of space travel. The development of alternate musical instruments from the 1960s up to the present day breaks the traditional musical paradigm of effort in performance. This development also shadows concepts of space exploration technology such as teleoperation. Musical instruments can be evaluated in terms of a new musical effort paradigm; a young generation seems content to accept that there may be no apparent correlation between input effort and sound output. This article explores what a contemporary notion of effort might be, inspired by a reading of Walt Whitman's poem 'I Sing the Body Electric'.},

@article{Stuart2003,
abstract = {The use of the laptop in performance causes various negative responses from the audience, who feel a loss of spectacle and performativity in the action. This occurs as a result of the lack of gesture and visual cues from the performer and the loss of focus from the audience, who have no visual object to ground their aural experience. A shift in focus from an understanding of the visual spectacle in performance to that of aural performativity is needed. Once this is understood, the audience can approach the performance with a shifted focus and come to new understandings of the aural object and contem porary digital audio.},

abstract = {When asked what musical instrument they play, few computer musicians respond spontaneously with ‘‘I play the computer.'' Why not? In this re- port, we examine the problems associated with the notion of the computer as musical instrument and the prospects for their solution. We begin with a discussion of our goals and re- quirements for computer-based musical instru- ments, raising the main issues that inform our work. Then we discuss a variety of metaphors for musical control that we have found to be powerful. Finally, we discuss some of the technology we have developed for implementing these instruments.},
