abstract = {Digital musical instruments bring about problems for performance that are different in kind to those brought about by conventional acoustic instruments. In this essay, I argue that one of the most significant of these problems is the way in which conventional computer interfaces preclude embodied modes of interaction. I examine the theoretical and technological foundations of this disconnect between performer and instrument, and sketch an outline for the design of embodied or enactive digital instruments. My research builds on recent work in human-computer interaction and soft artificial intelligence, and is informed by the phenomenology of Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty, as well as the enactive cognitive science of Francisco Varela and others. I examine the ways in which the conventional metaphors of computer science and hard artificial intelligence derive from a mechanistic model of human reasoning, and I outline how this model has informed the design of interfaces that inevitably lead to disembodied actional modes. I propose an alternative model of interaction that draws on various threads from the work of Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and the enactive cognitive scientists. The enactive model of interaction that I propose is concerned with circular chains of embodied interdependency between performer and instrument, instrumental resistance to human action and intentionality, and an integrative approach to the roles of sensing, acting and cognitive process in the incremental acquisition of performative skill. The final component of the essay is concerned with issues of implementation. I detail a project in hardware and software that I present as a candidate enactive digital musical instrument, I outline some specific usage examples, and I discuss prospects for future work. vi},

abstract = {Audiences of live laptop music frequently express dismay at the opacity of performer activity and question how ``live" performances actually are. Yet motionless laptop performers endure as musical spectacles from clubs to concert halls, suggesting that for many this is a non-issue. Understanding these perceptions might help performers better achieve their intentions, inform interface design within the NIME field and help develop theories of liveness and performance. To this end, a study of listeners' perception of liveness and performer control in laptop performance was carried out, in which listeners examined several short audio-only excerpts of laptop performances and answered questions about their perception of the performance: what they thought was happening and its sense of liveness. Our results suggest that audiences are likely to associate liveness with perceived performer activity such as improvisation and the audibility of gestures, whereas perceptions of generative material, backing tracks, or other preconceived material do not appear to inhibit perceptions of liveness.},

abstract = {The algorave movement has received reasonable international exposure in the last two years, including a series of concerts in Europe and beyond, and press coverage in a number of media. This paper seeks to illuminate some of the historical precedents to the scene, its primary aesthetic goals, and the divergent technological and musical approaches of representative participants. We keep in mind the novel possibilities in musical expression explored by algoravers. The scene is by no means homogeneous, and the very lack of uniformity of technique, from new live coding languages through code DJing to plug-in combination, with or without visual extension, is indicative of the flexibility of computers themselves as general information processors.},

@article{Cook2004,
abstract = {From the advent of electronic music, and even from early organ consoles and other remote manipulated instruments, much of the design and research of new musical interfaces has focused on abstracting (both physically and in the design process) the "controller" from the "synthesizer" and then investigating how to best interface those two classes of hardware with each other and the player. Yet, many of the striking lessons from our history of intimate expressive musical instruments lie in the blurred boundaries between player, controller, and sound producing object. Bowed strings, winds, and certainly the human voice all blur these boundaries, both in the design and construction of the "instrument" and in the resulting controls and expressions. This article looks at some of the issues involved with creating new expressive electronic musical instruments, and presents an overview of a number of recent projects in the co-design of musical controllers and computer sound synthesis algorithms. Specific cases are described where the traditional engineering approach of building a controller (a box), and connecting it to a synthesizer (another box) would never have yielded the final product that resulted from the tightly coupled development of a complete musical system all at the same time. Examples are given of where a discovery from synthesis algorithm development suggested a new control metaphor, and where a control component suggested a new aspect of synthesis.},

abstract = {Visualized emotion can be transmitted through minimal physical gestures in a musical performance; this process can be described as 'sentic', a term originally coined by Manfred Clynes in the 1970s during research into the effects of space travel. The development of alternate musical instruments from the 1960s up to the present day breaks the traditional musical paradigm of effort in performance. This development also shadows concepts of space exploration technology such as teleoperation. Musical instruments can be evaluated in terms of a new musical effort paradigm; a young generation seems content to accept that there may be no apparent correlation between input effort and sound output. This article explores what a contemporary notion of effort might be, inspired by a reading of Walt Whitman's poem 'I Sing the Body Electric'.},

This raises a new design challenge for HCI – how should spectators experience a performer's interaction with a computer? We classify public interfaces (including examples from art, performance and exhibition design) according to the extent to which a performer's manipulations of an interface and their resulting effects are hidden, partially revealed, fully revealed or even amplified for spectators. Our taxonomy uncovers four broad design strategies: ‘secretive,' where manipulations and effects are largely hidden; ‘expressive,' where they tend to be revealed enabling the spectator to fully appreciate the performer's interaction; ‘magical,' where effects are revealed but the manipulations that caused them are hidden; and finally ‘suspenseful,' where manipulations are apparent but effects are only revealed as the spectator takes their turn.},
